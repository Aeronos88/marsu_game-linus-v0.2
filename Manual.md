_So, you are here to know more about **Mars Survive mod** because a lot of things are confusing for first timers in Mars_ :confused: and there are :alien:s too. So Beware.

Very well, what are you waiting for?! Hop into your chair, put your finger on the scroll button/bar firmly and start reading.
Don't forget to take a break and sip of your favorite tea or coffee. :relieved:

<b>Note: This Manual will be a description of materials, mobs and the "friendly neighborhood superhero robo NPC at spawn" and their possible uses in this mod also it will serve as a basic tutorial to start. I wil try to keep it a little bit funny and sketchy with pictures as and when required; so you don't get bored up to sleep and wake up after dark and asking yourself "what goddamn day it is and where am i?!" etc</b> :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

MARS DEFAULT MATERIALS:

1. The damn **Mars Sand**:
  
  **Color**: Deep orange brownish i don't know what is that color

  **Place**: It just everywhere. You come out of spawn; its there, just below your feet. Ya! Its the same sand Mark Whatney used to mix with his :poop: to make a gooey puddle and grow potatoes. :flushed: But don't worry we have better and not so sh\**y plans to grow plants here.
  
  **Uses**: Ok enough :laughing: Be Serious. It can be used to `craft sand (white ones) by placing it in the crafting grid`. But it's better use is to make a sandstone and thereby sandstone bricks. `Put 3 blocks of mars sand in a column of the crafting grid and get a sandstone` (we will describe about it).
