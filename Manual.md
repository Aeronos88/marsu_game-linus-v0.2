_So, you are here to know more about **Mars Survive mod** because a lot of things are confusing for first timers in Mars_ :confused:

Very well, what are you waiting for?! Hop into your chair, put your finger on the scroll button/bar firmly and start reading.
Don't forget to take a break and sip of your favorite tea or coffee. :relieved:

<b>Note: This Manual will be a description of materials and their possible uses in this mod also it will serve as a basic tutorial to start. I wil try to keep it a little bit funny and sketchy with pictures as and when required; so you don't get bored up to sleep and wake up after a month or two.</b> :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
